# IGClass

This repository is the combined work from my "Interactive Graphics" CS
course from my senior year of high school. Viewable as a website in 
github pages, projects can be clicked on and viewed, with some projects
developed using p5.js being interactive (3D wireframe and 3D solar system).

Please take a look!
